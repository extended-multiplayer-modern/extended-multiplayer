# Extended Multiplayer (Ex-Mp)
**Extended Multiplayer (Ex-Mp)** is a modification that results from the reverse engineering of **GTA San Andreas** and its multiplayer mode. The purpose of this modification is to provide a more practical and advanced experience for fans of **GTA San Andreas** who want to enjoy multiplayer.
## Progress
This project is not yet "finished" or in a "stable" state. I am continuing to learn about reverse engineering, the tools and languages that are employed in the project.
## Project compiler?
The project will use the compiler **premake**, as it is a much more advanced and user-friendly tool.
